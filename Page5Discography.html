		<h2>÷</h2>
		<p>In the four years since Ed Sheeran established himself as Taylor Swift’s opening-act-slash-bestie, the British singer-songwriter hasn’t just become a star – he’s helped make over pop’s sound. Blending acoustic sensitive-guy vibes with digital-age craft, Sheeran has knocked out hits for Justin Bieber and One Direction while influencing the strummy likes of Lukas Graham and Shawn Mendes. On ÷, his first album since 2014’s X, Sheeran doubles down on the blend of hip-hop bravado and everyday-bloke songwriting that helped him break out at the turn of the decade.</p>

		<h2>+</h2>
		<p>Sheeran’s first LP is definitely his best album thus far. It was released in 2011, and it includes Grammy-nominated song “The A Team,” which skyrocketed the singer to stardom. The song’s upbeat rhythm in contrast to the dark lyrics makes it one of the best tracks in +. Moreover, powerful songs like “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You” and “Small Bump,” make this album the perfect example of Sheeran’s ability as a lyricist. Also, + includes fan-favorite tracks like “Drunk,” “Give Me Love” and “Lego House,” whose music video stars Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint. Overall, + is the proof of Ed Sheeran’s true vocal and instrumental talent.</p>

		<h2>No.6 Collaborations Project</h2>
		<p>Ed Sheeran’s latest LP is a collaborations project, and it is a continuation of the singer’s 2011 EP 5, a collection of Sheeran’s five pre-fame independently-released EPs. Sheeran invited many of his friends and colleagues, such as Stormzy, Eminem, Khalid and Ella Mai, to be part of this album. Even though the idea of getting a collaborations album sounded great, the results were not as good as his previous bodies of work. Almost all of the tracks sound the same, and the only worthwhile song is “Put It All On Me,” featuring Ella Mai. Even “Remember The Name,” featuring Eminem and 50 Cent, falls short in comparison to Sheeran’s previous collaboration with Eminem “River.”</p>

		<h2>5</h2>
		<p>5 is fan service in the best sense: a convenient way to get the five EPs Ed Sheeran released prior to signing with Atlantic Records in 2011. Released in the span of three years, these EPs include two collections of solo originals -- You Need Me, Loose Change -- a collection he wrote with Amy Wedge (aptly named Songs I Wrote with Amy), Live at the Bedford, and No. 5 Collaborations, where Sheeran teamed up with eight different collaborators. His full-length albums are perhaps more fully realized -- he's a singer/songwriter who benefits from a larger scale -- but these capture his puppy dog charm nicely.</p>
