      <p>Ed Sheeran is a singer/songwriter who began playing guitar at a young age and soon after started writing his own songs. When he was just a teenager, he moved to London to pursue his music, and his outpouring of creativity added up to several early EPs and hundreds of live shows. Drawing attention for his online performances, Sheeran hit No. 1 on the iTunes chart before he ever signed with a record label. Since signing with Atlantic, Sheeran has sold millions of records and won Grammys for hits like "Thinking Out Loud" and "Shape of You," as well as his 2018 album, รท.

      <h3> Shape of You </h3>
      <p > Outside of simply making radio airwaves and dance floors around the world blow up, what "Shape of You" did for Sheeran was put him on the map with people who didn't realize they enjoy his music. And while we're excited that Sheeran gained himself more fans with this bumpin' track, what we couldn't help saying is, "It's about time!"</p>

            <h3> Happier</h3>
      <p> While there is no denying that Sheeran established himself as a love-song master, what we hadn't seen a lot of from Mr. Romantic was a truly heartbreaking breakup song -- but, of course, he knows how to nail that as well. "Happier" tells the tale of watching your ex find love with someone else, when you're still not over them.</p>

                <h3> Castle on the Hill</h3>
      <p> Although simultaneously released single "Shape of You" was the one that really caught attention, this song is just as dynamic in its own way. It may not be a club banger like its sister single, but it tells the story of Sheeran's upbringing while also getting your heart pumping and making you sing and toe-tap along with its flowing melody. </p>

                <h3> Dive </h3>
      <p> By the time รท was released, it was no secret that Sheeran puts his all into his songs vocally. But once "Dive" came into Sheerios' lives, that point was proven even further. The way he passionately sings about his desired lover in the pre-chorus and chorus brings out some of the most ardent vocal strains of any Ed Sheeran song, making for one hell of a suitor serenade. </p>
